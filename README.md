## Project Overview: Employee Presence Analysis for AtliQ Technologies

### Problem Statement
Pinali Mandalia, HR at AtliQ Technologies, a data solutions firm, provided anonymized but real employee attendance data over a three-month period. This dataset included attendance key codes. The goal is to develop a dashboard to address HR-related queries, offering insights in an easily interpretable format.

### Project Requirements
The project revolved around an Excel dataset supplied by HR Manager Pinali, encompassing a three-month period. The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights from this data. Key areas of interest included identifying employees' work preferences, such as their choice of days for leave (especially Mondays or Fridays) or remote work. Additional considerations included understanding reasons for sick leave and evaluating if enhanced safety measures were needed in the office. Furthermore, AtliQ's team aimed to track employee attendance patterns to facilitate the planning of meetings, team lunches, and other company events.

### Methodology
The following steps were undertaken to achieve the project objectives:

1. **Data Integration**: Imported the Excel dataset into PowerBI.
2. **Data Transformation**: Conducted ETL processes and cleaned the data using Power Query.
3. **Measure Creation**: Developed various measures according to the project needs for use in visualizations.
4. **DAX Formulas**: Utilized DAX to create additional columns to aid in data analysis.
5. **Dashboard Development**: Designed and finalized a comprehensive PowerBI dashboard that meets the specified requirements.

### Project Outcome
The result is a user-friendly dashboard that provides clear insights into employee attendance trends and work preferences, aiding the HR team at AtliQ Technologies in making informed decisions.
